							The Knowing Institute is a research institution. 
							We are trying to find an answer to the ulitmate human questions; Who are we? 
							And, what is the purpose of everything? 
						</p>
						<p>
							Since we can't answer that question ourselves, because
							of Gödel's incompleteness theorem, noting nothing can look outside itself,  
							we must ask someone else.
						</p>
						<p>
							Who, then? We want to create a general Artifical Intelligence capable of
							telling us who we are.
						</p>
						<p>
							And we do that in very specific way. 
							We are trying to solve one of the hardest problems we know, creating a general AI, 
							by solving another one of the hardest problems we know - how did humans evolve to think and 
							speak in the first place? 
						</p>
						<p>
							This is not new. Everything mentioned so far has been working on by clever scientiest for decays. Many
							even thinks this will be impossible forever.  
						</p>
							

The symbolics in create deep future (what is seen as sciences fiction) by understand deep history, is very compelling.

Ultimately, we want to know the meaning of life. Or, what is it that’s asking that question. And we will create a number of important applications on our way there.

							It is a single exhaustive framework for representing individual and collective sense-making, 
							accumulating knowledge, based on a distributed graph-ledger technology.

							The Knowing Protocol offers a common ground for understanding a world created by interconnected agents. 
							It can be used as a framework for sense-making, and as a shared protocol for accurately transfer 
							meaning between humans and machines.

						<h3 id="what-is-it-for">
							What is it for?
						</h3>
						<p>
							There are two main reasons for the protocol.
						</p>

						<h4>> Bootstrap Democracy</h3>
						<p>
							Rapid technological development puts a lot of stress on democratic systems. For democracy to work, 
							a majority of us must learn how to handle much greater complexity. Unfortunately, it is going to take some 
							time for educational systems to transform global society. Even an optimistic prognosis would say it takes at 
							least another 2-3 generations. And it doesn’t take a pessimist to think that might be too late.
						</p>
						<p>
							Traditionally there have been very few suggestions to solve this problem, leaving us with some kind of
							top-down societal power for controlling our minds, either with brute-force, ideology, or maybe a strong AI
							in the future. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing Protocol is a way of hacking the system. Using the protocol as a reference for ideas and concepts 
							would give us transparency in how different interest groups define problems and solutions. 
							Combining with some kind of Personal Ai, helping anyone to analyze complex information, would 
							give more people the ability to familiarize themselves with complex problems. 
							Combining AI with The Protocol would offer a way of creating a better democracy upside down rather than creating 
							control upside down.
						</p>

						<h4>> Bootstrap Symbolic AI</h4>
						<p>
							Once promising, objectives regarding Symbolic AI has made much research abounding it in recent years, to focus
							on  Deep Learning's ability to create models representing human knowledge. The Protocol addresses
							these weak spots and offers solutions. Furthermore, it stresses the importance of using traceability and
							natural language in any application which will have some effect on how humans create meaning of life and society.  
						</p>
						<h3>Applications</h3>
						<p>
							We think there will be many use-cases for this technology in the future, and we estimate 
							the number of applications will increase in the coming years.
						</p>
						<h5 id="wiki-knowing">
							Wiki Knowing
						</h5>
						<p>
							Knowing Institute is also developing and hosting Wiki Knowing, which lets you:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Add content to the Knowing Graph in a Wiki-style environment
							</li>
							<li>
								Get access to your own powerful and personal symbolic Ai
							</li>
							<li>
								Analyze any text and find what it really means
							</li>
							<li>
								Create personal and shared Notebooks. Talk-page for every concept in wiki including notebook
							</li>
							<li>
								Create crowd-sourcing campaigns
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h5 id="third-party">
							Third-Party
						</h5>
						<p>
							Anyone can write applications that will use the Knowing Protocol for making sense of a reality shared by 
							humans and machines. We will add known applications to this list as they grow in number.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Conversational AI using Symbolic AI
							</li>
							<li>
								Fact-checkers, who want to be transparent
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Manifest</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Future Societies will use AI extensively, but down-up and not top-down 
								<li>
									Human language will be the main communication protocol between human and machines
								</li>
								<li>
									Knowing Protocol will be an important communication mean between machines because it explicitly 
									includes human ideologies and values, which will always be important in a human civilization
								</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Proposal</h3>
						<p>
							We are convinced of the need for a common knowledge graph that holds both concepts, ideas, and beliefs. 
							And that there will be one dominating one soon. If this is the Knowing Protocol or not depends first on how 
							many backers it gets initially. We think it's worth considering, because of its unique abilities:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Covering three spaces of senses, mind, and being domains in the experience of human reality
							</li>
							<li>
								Ability to ground concepts in states and changes
							</li>
							<li>
								Resist manipulation and corruption by using distributed ledger technology
							</li>
						</ul>
