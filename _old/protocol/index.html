					<h4>Abstract</h4>
					<p>
						<i>The Knowing Protocol</i> is a <i>semantic network</i> and a <i>blockchain of ideas</i>, 
						which offers an alternative solution for societal problems coming from diverse sense-making processes. 
						Instead of trying to control minds top-down in an attempt to create a stable society, it offers a way to 
						bootstrap democracy by being a reference point when communicating ideas, and a schema for understanding 
						any reality experienced by humans. This also offers a solution to future problems when Artificial Intelligence 
						will outperform human cognitive abilities, giving us transparency and traceability.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>The Semantic Network</i> differs from previous semantic network attempts in several ways, 
						most notably by introducing the domains <i>Sense</i>, <i>Mind</i>, and <i>Being</i>, and adding forms for 
						<i>state-handling</i>, which opens for creating abstract representations of <i>ethical systems</i>. 
						It also holds the ability to give concepts grounded meanings -  an important function when creating AI-systems 
						understanding human language.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>The Blockchain</i> consists of a primary layer, which holds concepts and ideas which can be agreed upon 
						by all humankind, including shared values and concepts related to human rights. This layer can only change 
						when two-thirds of token-holders agree. Secondary layers can be any science knowledge or ideology which 
						doesn't pass the way to be included in the primary layer. Third-level layers are outside the distributed 
						ledger and hold any fictional or real human/machine representation which may include unique memories, 
						knowledge, opinions, etc. All layers offer means of traceability.
					</p>
					<p>The Semantic Network definition can be summarized in this prototype:</p>
					<ol class="prototype">
						<li><i>Reality</i> is; <b>physical objects with properties</b></li>
						<li>and <b>abstract ideas</b>, </li>
						<li>represented by <b>symbols</b></li>
						<li>that are <b>categorized</b>, </li> 
						<li>have <b>relations</b>,</li>
						<li>and can <b>interact</b> with each other</li>
						<li>within <b>restrictions</b>, </li>
						<li>interpreted in <b>contexts</b> by <i>agents</i></li>
						<li>having <b>bias and ethics</b>,</li>
						<li>giving them <b>attributes and meaning</b>.</li>

					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						There have been several attempts for creating an abstract representation of human knowledge through 
						a semantic network, which is a knowledge base representing semantic relations between concepts in 
						a network useful for solving problems by artificial reasoning.
					</p>
					<p> 
						Some well-known examples are Wordnet, Conceptnet, Cycorp, and some proprietary graphs from Google, 
						Facebook, etc. While they all add value in their own specialized field, neither of them offers an 
						exhausting representation of how interconnected agents create meaning of a reality comprising both 
						real-world objects and emerging ideas. At best they offer only a single single-dimensional 
						representation of something not well-specified.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="why-do-we-need-this">
					<h3>Why do we need this?</h3>
					<p>
						There are several reasons why we need a single model for representing individual and collective 
						sense-making, accumulate knowledge, and enable efficient information transfer between humans and 
						machines. 
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Having a shared reference point</i>, so we know what we are talking about. This will help 
							us detect how our ideas relate to each other and how the concepts we are using for describing 
							reality change not only depending on who is using them, but even in what context we are using 
							them alone. Once we have this reference point, we can focus on real discussions, and not only 
							debating how to describe the reality.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Give more people the ability to understand complex problems</i> using powerful Artificial 
							Intelligence based on this shared knowledge of world-, semantic- and agent-centric objects. 
							That kind of AI would be an instrument for creating a better democracy bottom-up rather than 
							having a government using AI for controlling the masses top-down.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Create a new kind of Artificial Intelligence</i> combining Deep Learning and Symbolic Reasoning, 
							addressing challenges of reasoning, hierarchical representations, and learning transfer. 
							A huge benefit would be to get traceability of how AI is modeling the reality and makes decisions, 
							something which is very difficult in pure statistical deep learning models.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="a-new-approach">
					<h3>A new approach</h3>
					<p>
						The Knowing Protocol has a what-works-works approach, which means whatever works in practice might also 
						work in theory. Even if the process of creating the model includes extended research in multiple fields, 
						including linguistics, semantics, psychology, and philosophy, it has no ambitions of taking on a more 
						philosophical or academic approach than necessary. It has emerged from a learn-by-prototyping process 
						after finding there were no existing semantic frameworks covering the full extent of human knowledge 
						including individual and collective sense-making. Given that, it is still a work in progress and will 
						be continuously developed as the need for new qualities rises.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Protocol uses these existing frameworks as starting points:
					</p> 
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PropBank" target="_blank">PropBank</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roget%27s_Thesaurus" target="_blank">Roget Thesaurus</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">Blockchain</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The primary take-aways from the Knowing Protocol are:
					</p> 
					<ul>
						<li>Connecting mentioned frameworks in a single model</li>
						<li>Introducing <a href="#domains">three domains; Sense, Mind and Being</a></li>
						<li>Introducing a method for grounding meaning using semantic frameworks for <a href="#state-handling">state, cause-effect, time and storytelling</a></li>
						<li>Introducing <a href="#blockchain">blockchain of ideas</a>, including layers, tokens, and support for transaction fingerprints</a>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="related-research">
					<h5>Problems with Symbolic Ai</h5>
					<p>
						The Protocol permits the use of Symbolic Ai, which is often criticized for:
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Being monotonic</i>, ie it is difficult to change beliefs once they are encoded in a rules engine. 
							Knowing Protocol tries to solve that problem by<a href="#operations">Semantic Operations</a>
							and transactions in a <a href="#blockchain">blockchain</a>.
						</li>  
						<li>
							<i>Not having any real mening,</i> ie symbols are not grounded and it’s difficult to relate them to 
							other forms of meaning. Knowing Protocol tries to solve that problem the<a href="#domains">Three Domains</a> 
							and the breakdown of Concepts into <a href=#"state-handling">States</a>. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Force machines to communicate through natural language</i> although it is probably not optimal for 
							machine-to-machine communication. The purpose of the Knowing Protocol is to create shared semantic networks 
							both humans and machines can understand and use, so the basis for the protocol is the opposite:
							<i>it's necessary for any communication describing a human-centric reality to use natural language</i>, including 
							machine-to-machine communication in that domain.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section id="model" class="new">
					<h2>The Model</h2>
					<p>
						The Knowing Protocol describes how to draw a knowledge graph comprising vertices representing semantic symbols 
						and edges representing semantic relations between these symbols. 
					</p>
				</section>
						
				<section id="prototype">
					<h3>Prototype</h3>
					<p>
						The protocol specifies how to use a semantic network for describing reality, and it is best summarized in this prototype:
					</p>
					<ol class="prototype">
						<li><i>Reality</i> is; <b>physical objects with properties</b> 
							<article>
								Our basic understanding of the physical world is it consists of objects with measurable properties, which may be the result of a physical process.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>and <b>abstract ideas</b>, 
							<article>
								Ideas are mental objects or mental states which an agent uses when making sense of physical objects or ideas.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>represented by <b>symbols</b> 
							<article>
								We create an abstract representation of the language we use when interpreting objects and ideas.  
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>that are <b>categorized</b>,
							<article>
								We categorize these symbols so they make more sense to us. For example, we call some of them Nouns, and some of them a Color. Or mammals. 
							</article>
						</li> 
						<li>have <b>relations</b>, 
							<article>
								We relate these symbols with each-other for understanding concepts, cause-effect, meaning, etc.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>and can <b>interact</b> with each other
							<article>
								Symbols (ie physical objects and ideas) can interact with each other in different ways. 
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>within <b>restrictions</b>, 
							<article>
								Interactions between symbols can only happen within given restrictions; physical, social, psychological, etc.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>interpreted in <b>contexts</b> by <i>agents</i>
							<article>
								Whenever a symbol, or groups of symbols, are understood by an agent (human or machine), that's happening within a context, like a conversation, culture, ideology, etc.
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>having <b>bias and ethics</b>,
							<article>
								Agents have bias and an ethical system, which happens when symbols and relations in the model are compared and valued, especially around cause-effect and choice.  
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>giving them <b>attributes and meaning</b>.
							<article>
								When agents interpret symbols in a sense-making process, based on context, bias, and ethics, they give symbols attributes and meaning.  
							</article>
						</li>
					</ol>

				</section>

				<section id="domains">
					<h3>Domains</h3>
					<p>
						All symbols are conceptual, which means they all represent mental objects or mental states used by agents when 
						making sense of their reality. They are then divided into three domains based on how they are used in that process; 
						based on how humans experience their reality and where their attention is in that process. 
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Senses Domain</i> 
							<article>
								Answers the question: <i>What Is</i>? Attention is close to our senses. 
							</article>
							 
						</li>
						<li><i>Mind Domain</i>
							<article>
								Answers the question: <i>What Reveals</i>? Attention is more in our mind. 
							</article>
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Being Domain</i>
							<article>
								Answers the question: <i>What Ought</i>? Attention is more settled in being. 
							</article>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Another way of naming the domains could be <i>hand-thought-gut</i>.
					</p>
					<h4>Senses Domain</h4>
					<p>
						Semantic symbols and relations in the Senses domain are close to the real world, 
						they often represent a physical object or processes with measurable properties. 
						These symbols generally don't need reasoning or abstract thinking.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Symbols in this domain originate from the question: <em>What is?</em></li>
						<li>They are close to what we as humans can experience through our senses</li>
						<li>They appear to us when we have our attention outside ourselves.</li>
						<li>Example: <i>This flower is red. The Universe is big. Chickens lay eggs</i>. </li> 
					</ul>

					<h4>Mind Domain</h4>
					<p>
						Symbols in the mind domain are more abstract and related to thinking, reasoning, 
						and concepts generated by reflection or a thought process. 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Symbols raises from the question: <em>What Reveals?</em></li>
						<li>They appear to us when our attention to some extent needs to be inside our minds.</li>
						<li>Most of the symbols, relations, and categories found in the semantic network are here.</li>
						<li>Example: <i>Some flowers are red. Universe has a lot of undiscovered black holes. Chickens learn to walk before they can fly.</i></li>
						<li>Subdomains are then representing the complexity of ideas</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Being Domain</h4>
					<p>
						Symbols in the being domain come from agent-centric processes, how agent attribute symbols in previous domains, 
						and are related to preferences, values, and ethical system. 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Symbol raises from the question: <em>What ought?</em></li>
						<li>They appear to us when we have our attention deeper inside ourselves</li>
						<li>They come from our experience and beliefs</li>
						<li>I like red flowers. Universe seams terrifying. I want a chicken for president.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						A complete reference of symbols are found in the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>. 
					</p>

				<section id="state-handling">
					<h3>State handling</h3>
					<p>
						The protocol permits to group symbols into states and then relates these states with each-other for 
						describing <i>Change</i>. This is usable in many ways;
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Grounded Meaning</i><br/>
							We can define a concept as the difference between different states, and by that add more ground to it's meaning.
							We need to explain grounded meaning and agent-centric meaning better later, including how to use
							examples and storytelling for create meaning. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Relation to time</i><br/>
							We can connect states to time-stamps and time-scopes, and order events after when they occur in any given timeline. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Cause-Effect</i><br/>
							States can capture cause-effect-relations. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Storytelling</i><br/>
							Storytelling is a fundamental way of understanding reality for humans. It's also a way of grounding the 
							knowledge for Ai. Without storytelling, the knowledge doesn't have the same meaning 
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Ethical System</i><br/>
							We can use states for attaching values in the Being-domain to changes between states, ie an agent can have a 
							preference connected to any change, which is the base for an ethical system.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Protocol uses states instead of many relations found in other frameworks.

					<h2>Operations</h2>
					<p>
						The Protocole permits a set of semantic network operations which are important for making

					<h3>Layers</h3>
					<p>
						The Semantic Network can in theory hold an unlimited number of layers, where each layer is a set

					</p>
					<p>	
						The Blockchain protocol defines a primary layer holding general knowledge agreed upon by most 
						of humankind. Anyone can define a second layer based on specific scientific knowledge or ideology, 
						and load that on top of the primary layer when for instance performing a task of analyzing a text. 
						The result of that task will then be based on the sum of all layers currently loaded in the semantic network.

					<p>
						Displacement of concepts is an important quality in the semantic network. It describes 
						how a concept can change the definition by placing a clone of itself in a separate context, 
						as a way of altering its definition in a particular use-case.

					<h2>The Blockchain</h2>
					<p>
						The <i>"Blockchain of Ideas"</i> is defined as a distributed ledger system, 
						utilizing blockchain technology.
					</p>
					<h4>Layers</h4>
					<p>
						The Blockchain holds three different types of layers:
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>Primary Layer</i> holding concepts and ideas which could be agreed upon 
							by all humankind, including shared values and concepts related to human rights. 
							This layer can only change when two-thirds of token-holders agree
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Secondary Layers</i> holding any science knowledge or ideology which doesn't 
							pass the way to be included in the primary layer. These layers are created 
							open-source and driven in community-style development.
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Type-3 Layers</i> holding knowledge, memories, opinions, ethical systems 
							connected to fictional or real human/machine representations. These layers lays 
							outside the distributed ledger and can be used as layers in any application. 
							They also lack a centralized way to trace transactions.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Tokens</h4>
					<p>
						Blockchain tokens called <i>Knowens</i> are used for voting on changes in the primary layer. 
						Owners of Knowens will be institutions representing different cultures.
					</p>
					<h4>Fingerprint and traceability</h4>
					<p>
						Every statement generated by a future Artificial Intelligence using the Knowing Protocol will 
						generate a fingerprint which makes it possible to trace what ideas and concept, and what definitions, 
						is has used to come to that conclusions. This will make it possible to counter-act forgery of 
						mind and control by AI top-down. 
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="implementation" class="new">
					<h2>Implementation</h2>
					<p>
						The implementation of the Knowing Protocol will be arranged by Knowing Institute in a module-based 
						rapid prototyping style project, including the following blocks:
					</p>
					<ul class="statements">
						<li>
							<i>The Organization</i>, including:
							<ul>
								<li>Advisory board</li>
								<li>Network of ambassadors</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>The Protocol</i>, including:
							<ul>
								<li>Involve experts from different fields to add suggestions</li>
								<li>Improve the protocol</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Technology</i>, including:
							<ul>
								<li>Finish development of the open-source distributed graph ledger</li>
								<li>Finish development of wiki-knowing</li>
								<li>Develop fingerprint technology for future transactions based on AI</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Primary Layer</i>, including: 
							<ul>
								<li>Converting existing sources of inforamtion to primary layer</li>
								<li>Distribute Knowens-tokens to instiutions</li>
								<li>Establish a common ground</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<i>Secondary and Third Layers</i>, including: 
							<ul>
								<li>Invite people to create secondary candidates on the wiki-platform</li>
								<li>Develop and offer SDK for the user of Layer-3 in any application</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We respect it will take time to fill this semantic network with content. 
					</p>
