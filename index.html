							Knowing Institute is the protector of the Knowing Protocol. 
							The Knowing Protocol offers a common ground for understanding our world. 
							It can be used as a framework for sense-making, and as a shared protocol for accurately transfer 
							meaning between humans, and between humans and machines. 
						</p>
						<p>
							It is a single exhaustive framework for representing individual and collective sense-making, 
							accumulating knowledge, based on a distributed graph-ledger technology.
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing Institute protects the protocol and coordinates the continuous growth of content.
						</p>
						<h3 id="what-is-it-for">
							What is it for?
						</h3>
						<p>
							There are two main reasons for the protocol.
						</p>

						<h4>> Bootstrap Democracy</h3>
						<p>
							Rapid technological development puts a lot of stress on democratic systems. For democracy to work, 
							a majority of us must learn how to handle much greater complexity. Unfortunately, it is going to take some 
							time for educational systems to transform global society. Even an optimistic prognosis would say it takes at 
							least another 2-3 generations. And it doesn’t take a pessimist to think that might be too late.
						</p>
						<p>
							Traditionally there have been very few suggestions to solve this problem, leaving us with some kind of
							top-down societal power for controlling our minds, optionally with brute-force, ideology, or maybe a strong AI
							in the future. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Knowing Protocol is a way of hacking the system. Using the protocol as a reference for ideas and concepts 
							would give us transparency in how we all create different definitions of both problems and solutions. 
							Combining with Symbilic AI-systems, anyone can analyze complex information, and this would 
							give more people the ability to understand complex problems and give way for a better implemented democrazy.
						</p>

						<h4>> Bootstrap Symbolic AI</h4>
						<p>
							Once promising, objectives regarding Symbolic AI has made much research abounding it in recent years, to focus
							on  Deep Learning's ability to create models representing human knowledge. The Protocol addresses
							these weak spots and offers solutions. Furthermore, it stresses the importance of using traceability and
							natural language in any application which will have some effect on how humans create meaning of life and society.  
						</p>


						<h3>What exactly is the problem?</h3>
						<p>
							Language has the potential of connecting us on the deepest level, like we can experience reading poetry and literature.
							It gives us means for sharing values, visions and meaning. 
							Using language for collective sense-making on the other hand, especially combined with modern technology, 
							is problematic.
						</p>
						<p>
							If language would have be invented today, it would probably not have been our preferable tool for
							collective sense-making,
							because it’s difficult to use, we regularly misunderstand one each-other and it can easily be utilized for manipulation. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This could very well be a cause for many of the problems our society is experiencing today, 
							like pseudo-democracy, people are too easy being manipulated, 
							information having too high complexity, fake news, populism, tribalism, etc - we can see all these problems, 
							but the world is not really able to respond.
						</p>
						<p>
							We find ourselves in a very difficult situation, well described by Jonatan Rowson at 
							<a href="https://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation/">Perspectiva</a>:
						</p>
						<quote>
							"We live in an age of dissonance. The complexity and pace of events has long since eclipsed the complexity of human consciousness, 
							yet social, political and professional conventions oblige us to talk and act as if we know what we are doing."
						</quote>
						<p>
							A lot of this complexity comes from the lack of transparency and integrity in our language: it simply
							cannot be used effectively for the purpose of collective sense-making. 
						</p>
						<p>
							To make things even worse; AI research is currently not leading us to a good place. We will soon face challenges like people 
							taking advantage of potent AI-systems for manipulating information in ways including multi-step changes of people and society, 
							which no human or machine will be able to figure out or be prepared for.
						</p>
						<p> 
							We are just in the beginning of a war of ideas, and things are frankly looking quite bad. 
							And available solutions tried before, including diffusing of the minds, oppressing leaderships, rule by ideology, or some future superior AI, are not favorable in the light of human rights.
						</p>
						<p>	
							Alternative solutions prototyped as “Game B”, “Revolutionizing Education Systems”, or even some kind of “Integral Consciousness Flip” seem far-fetched or in best case really difficult to pull through. 
						</p>

						<h3>Proposal</h3>
						<p>
							We are currently working on our proposal using Blockchain technology for adding transparency and integrity to human language,
							because we are convinced of the need for a this common reference of meaning:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Covering the full experience of human reality including concepts, ideas, and beliefs
							</li>
							<li>
								Ability to ground concepts in semantic primes, states and changes
							</li>
							<li>
								Holding all sorts of collective and individual sense-making
							</li>
							<li>
								Resist manipulation and corruption by using distributed ledger technology
							</li>
							<li>
								Giving us additional clarity when using human language
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Vision statement</h4>
						<p>
							We want to boost democracy by giving people tools for detecting information bias, manipulation, 
							and diffusion of minds. We also want to provide new protocols for transparent communication 
							from AI-based systems, and improving the odds of creating a sustainable and humanistic future society.
						</p> 
						
						<h4>Who is it for?</h4>
						<p>This is for:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Content creators who want to be aware of bias in their communications</li>
							<li>AI researchers who seek transparency and acceptance of their products</li>
							<li>People who want powerful tools for helping them understand complexity</li>
							<li>Fact-checkers (who is fact-checking the fact-checkers? this is!)</li>
							<li>Whoever wants to have a reference of meaning</li>
							<li>Democratic societies wanting to give people tools for participating in democratic processes</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h4>Why do we need it?</h4>
						<p>
							Misinformation, fake news, populism, tribalism, and too high complexity are real problems in our society, 
							but the world is not really able to respond. We need tools that can help us handle the complexity, 
							ensure transparency and accountability on infrastructures, and help us trust information.
						</p>
						
						<h4>Top Features</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A semantic knowledge graph for anchoring concept’s meaning using semantic primes, 
								aiming at adding transparency and integrity to human language
							</li>
							<li>A blockchain-based graph for building trust in how concepts are defined, having three layers with different 
								scopes of contexts to these definitions (humanity, community, individual)
							</li>
							<li>A protocol for giving AI-models transparency on what concepts and definitions they use when communicating 
								(“We only listen if you share your definitions”)
							</li>
							<li>
								Tools for analyzing complex information, identifying hidden bias and misinformation.
							</li>
						</ul>
